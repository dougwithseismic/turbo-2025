# Crawler Service Test Plan

## Overview

The crawler service is responsible for crawling web pages and analyzing their content using various plugins. We need to implement proper tests following TDD principles.

## Test Categories

### 1. Service Initialization

- [ ] Test service initialization with default settings
- [ ] Test service initialization with custom plugins
- [ ] Test plugin initialization error handling

### 2. Job Management

- [ ] Test job creation with various configurations
- [ ] Test job retrieval
- [ ] Test job progress tracking
- [ ] Test job completion
- [ ] Test job failure handling

### 3. Crawling Process

- [ ] Test URL validation and normalization
- [ ] Test robots.txt parsing and respect
- [ ] Test sitemap parsing
- [ ] Test depth limiting
- [ ] Test URL filtering
- [ ] Test custom headers and user agent setting

### 4. Page Analysis

- [ ] Test basic page metrics collection
- [ ] Test plugin metric collection
- [ ] Test error handling during analysis
- [ ] Test resource timing collection
- [ ] Test redirect handling

### 5. Plugin System

- [ ] Test plugin initialization
- [ ] Test plugin metric collection
- [ ] Test plugin result summarization
- [ ] Test plugin error handling
- [ ] Test disabled plugin behavior

### 6. Error Handling

- [ ] Test network error handling
- [ ] Test timeout handling
- [ ] Test invalid configuration handling
- [ ] Test plugin failure handling
- [ ] Test resource limit handling

### 7. Event System

- [ ] Test job start events
- [ ] Test job complete events
- [ ] Test job error events
- [ ] Test page start events
- [ ] Test page complete events
- [ ] Test page error events
- [ ] Test progress events

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up test environment
   - [ ] Configure Vitest for crawler service
   - [ ] Set up Playwright test utilities
   - [ ] Create mock plugins for testing

2. Create test utilities
   - [ ] Mock browser context
   - [ ] Mock page object
   - [ ] Mock crawler responses
   - [ ] Test data generators

3. Implement tests by category
   - Start with service initialization
   - Move to job management
   - Continue with crawling process
   - Add page analysis tests
   - Cover plugin system
   - Ensure error handling
   - Verify event system

4. Refactor and optimize
   - [ ] Extract common test patterns
   - [ ] Improve test readability
   - [ ] Optimize test performance
   - [ ] Add test documentation

## Dependencies

- Vitest for test framework
- Playwright for browser automation
- Crawlee for crawling functionality
- Custom plugins for analysis

## Notes

- Each test should be focused and isolated
- Use proper mocking to avoid external dependencies
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- Document edge cases and assumptions
- Consider performance implications
