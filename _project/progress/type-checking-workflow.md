## 2024-12-31 - Implemented Type Checking Workflow for LLM Development

Cline

### Summary

Established a systematic approach to TypeScript type checking during LLM-assisted development, focusing on incremental fixes and type safety verification.

### Completed Tasks

- Created TypeScript type checking workflow documentation
- Implemented pattern for LLM-assisted type checking
- Demonstrated workflow with auth feature fixes
- Fixed cascading type errors in theme system
- Updated component types for better type safety

### Learnings

- Type errors should be fixed in dependency order (types -> implementations -> usage)
- Running type checks after each change prevents error cascades
- LLM-generated code needs systematic type verification
- Breaking changes into small, verifiable steps improves reliability
- Documenting type decisions helps maintain consistency
- CRITICAL: Never modify or remove existing business logic when fixing types
- Learned from mistake: Accidentally removed ApplicationShell functionality while fixing types
- Solution: Update only type definitions and type-related code, preserve all functionality
- Always review the full context of a feature before making type changes

### Blockers

[None]

### Next Steps

- Set up automated type checking in CI pipeline
- Create type checking scripts for common workflows
- Add type coverage metrics
- Document common type error patterns
- Create type checking checklists for new features
- Add safeguards against accidental functionality removal

### Technical Notes

- Type checking command: `cd apps/web && npx tsc --noEmit`
- Start with interface/type fixes before implementations
- Document complex type decisions
- Use type assertions sparingly
- Maintain strict type boundaries between features
- Consider adding type-coverage tool for metrics
- Always preserve existing functionality while fixing types
- Review feature documentation and tests before making changes
