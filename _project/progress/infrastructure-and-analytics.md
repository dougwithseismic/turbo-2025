### Summary

Core infrastructure is now in place with Next.js, Supabase, Express servers, and Redis. Analytics implementation is progressing well with hooks and testing coverage. Project management features are operational.

### Completed Tasks

- Base infrastructure setup (Next.js, Supabase, Express, Redis)
- Analytics package implementation with hooks
- Application shell with project management
- Project creation and switching functionality
- Started onboarding flow implementation

### Learnings

- Structured analytics implementation with dedicated hooks improves testability
- Feature-based organization with proper testing setup accelerates development
- Modular package structure in monorepo enables better code sharing

### Blockers

- Monitoring setup (Prometheus + Grafana) needs completion
- Development environment setup pending

### Next Steps

1. Complete monitoring infrastructure setup
2. Finish analytics implementation and testing
3. Begin crawler service development
4. Continue onboarding flow implementation
5. Start dashboard layout development

### Technical Notes

- Analytics using custom hooks pattern for better reusability
- Project switching implemented with React Query for efficient data fetching
- Test coverage being maintained across new features
- Monorepo structure proving effective for shared code
