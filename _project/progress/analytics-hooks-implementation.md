## 2024-12-29 - Implemented Type-Safe Analytics Hooks with Full Test Coverage

Cline

### Summary

Implemented and tested domain-specific analytics hooks for onboarding and project features, ensuring type safety and consistent event tracking. Added comprehensive test coverage setup across all apps in the monorepo.

### Completed Tasks

- Implemented type-safe analytics hooks for onboarding and project features
- Added test coverage configuration to all apps (web, api, queue-workers)
- Created comprehensive test suites for analytics hooks
- Added documentation for test coverage patterns

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Analytics Hooks

1. **Onboarding Analytics** (`lib/analytics/hooks/use-onboarding-analytics.ts`)
   - Step completion tracking
   - Form submission events
   - Error handling

2. **Project Analytics** (`lib/analytics/hooks/use-project-analytics.ts`)
   - Project creation events
   - Project switching tracking
   - Metadata enrichment

#### 2. Test Coverage

1. **Onboarding Analytics Tests**
   - Step completion validation
   - Error state handling
   - Event property verification

2. **Project Analytics Tests**
   - Creation event validation
   - Switching event tracking
   - Error scenarios

### Key Improvements

1. **Type Safety**
   - Strongly typed hook parameters
   - Event type validation
   - Compile-time checks

2. **Testing**
   - Unit test coverage
   - Mock analytics tracking
   - Edge case handling

3. **Code Organization**
   - Modular hook structure
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Reusable test utilities

### Benefits

1. **Development**
   - Improved type inference
   - Better error handling
   - Consistent event tracking

2. **Quality**
   - Test coverage
   - Reliable tracking
   - Maintainable code

3. **Analytics**
   - Structured events
   - Consistent properties
   - Reliable tracking

### Learnings

- Importance of strict typing for analytics events
- Value of comprehensive test coverage across all apps
- Benefits of consistent coverage configuration in monorepo

### Blockers

[None]

### Next Steps

1. **Coverage**
   - Additional feature hooks
   - Integration tests
   - E2E tracking validation

2. **Documentation**
   - Hook usage examples
   - Event schema docs
   - Testing patterns

### Technical Notes

- React Query integration
- Vitest coverage setup with v8 provider
- TypeScript strict mode
- Custom hook patterns
