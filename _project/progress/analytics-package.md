## 2024-02-14 - Analytics Package Implementation

### Summary

Implemented a robust, type-safe analytics package with support for multiple providers and advanced features. The package provides a flexible plugin architecture with middleware support for various functionality like validation, batching, retry mechanisms, consent management, and session tracking.

### Completed Tasks

- ✅ Core analytics implementation with plugin architecture
- ✅ Google Analytics 4 plugin with proper typing
- ✅ Event validation using zod schemas
- ✅ Batch processing middleware for optimizing network requests
- ✅ Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- ✅ GDPR-compliant consent management
- ✅ Session tracking with automatic timeout
- ✅ Comprehensive TypeScript types
- ✅ Detailed documentation

### Learnings

- Middleware pattern provides excellent extensibility while maintaining clean code
- Type-safe event tracking requires careful design of type system
- Session tracking needs to handle various edge cases (page visibility, focus events)
- Consent management should be flexible enough to handle different regulatory requirements
- Batch processing needs to balance performance with reliability

### Technical Notes

- Used TypeScript's type system to ensure type safety across all features
- Implemented plugin architecture for extensibility
- Used middleware pattern for feature composition
- Added zod schemas for runtime validation
- Implemented proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- Added session management with persistence
- Ensured GDPR compliance with consent management

### Next Steps

- [ ] Add more analytics providers:
  - [ ] Mixpanel plugin
  - [ ] PostHog plugin
  - [ ] Amplitude plugin
- [ ] Add error tracking middleware
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests:
  - [ ] Unit tests for core functionality
  - [ ] Integration tests for plugins
  - [ ] E2E tests for middleware stack
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Add debugging tools
- [ ] Add more examples in documentation

### Architecture Decisions

1. Plugin Architecture
   - Allows easy addition of new analytics providers
   - Enables feature composition through middleware

2. Middleware Pattern
   - Provides clean separation of concerns
   - Makes features optional and composable
   - Allows for easy testing and maintenance

3. Type System
   - Ensures type safety at compile time
   - Provides excellent developer experience with autocomplete
   - Makes refactoring safer

4. Event Validation
   - Uses zod for runtime validation
   - Provides clear error messages
   - Ensures data quality

5. Session Management
   - Handles page visibility and focus events
   - Provides automatic timeout
   - Persists session data across page loads

6. Consent Management
   - GDPR-compliant by design
   - Flexible categories system
   - Supports event queueing

### Impact

- Improved developer experience with type safety
- Reduced network requests through batching
- Better reliability with retry mechanism
- GDPR compliance out of the box
- Enhanced analytics with session tracking

### Dependencies

- zod: For runtime validation
- typescript: For type safety
- vitest: For testing
