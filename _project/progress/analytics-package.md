## 2024-01-10 - Enhanced Analytics Package with Offline Support Documentation

### Summary

Added comprehensive documentation for the analytics package's batching and offline support capabilities, improving developer experience and understanding of these critical features.

### Completed Tasks

- Added detailed offline support documentation to API reference
- Created dedicated batching-and-offline.md guide
- Documented BatchMiddleware features and configuration
- Added practical usage examples and best practices

### Technical Details

#### Documentation Structure

1. **API Reference Updates**
   - Added BatchMiddleware configuration details
   - Documented offline support features
   - Added code examples for common use cases
   - Improved organization with dedicated sections

2. **Standalone Guide (batching-and-offline.md)**
   - Comprehensive overview of features
   - Configuration examples
   - Usage patterns
   - Best practices
   - Implementation details
   - Debugging tips

#### Key Features Documented

1. **Batch Processing**
   - Event batching configuration
   - Batch size and timing controls
   - Page unload handling
   - Retry mechanisms

2. **Offline Support**
   - Automatic online/offline detection
   - Event persistence in localStorage
   - Queue processing and ordering
   - Error handling and recovery

3. **Implementation Examples**

   ```typescript
   const analytics = new Analytics({
     middleware: [
       new BatchMiddleware({
         maxSize: 10,
         maxWait: 5000,
         flushOnUnload: true,
         maxRetries: 3
       })
     ]
   });
   ```

### Testing

- Verified all code examples
- Confirmed documentation accuracy against implementation
- Validated configuration options
- Tested offline scenarios

### Next Steps

1. Add integration tests for offline scenarios
2. Consider adding monitoring for offline queue size
3. Document performance optimization strategies
4. Add TypeScript examples for custom event handling

### Technical Notes

- BatchMiddleware uses localStorage for offline storage
- Events are processed in FIFO order
- Automatic retry mechanism for failed events
- Network state changes are handled automatically
