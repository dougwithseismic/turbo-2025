Areas for Improvement:


Error Handling:
While errors are logged, there's no built-in error reporting/monitoring
Could benefit from more detailed error categorization
Documentation:
While comprehensive, could use more real-world examples
Performance tuning guidelines could be more detailed
Missing documentation about error handling strategies
Testing:
While test files exist, coverage of edge cases could be improved
More integration tests would be valuable
Recommendations:

Fix the batch processing implementation to properly handle events instead of skipping them
Add more sophisticated retry strategies with exponential backoff
Implement proper error categorization and reporting
Add performance monitoring capabilities
Enhance documentation with more real-world examples and troubleshooting guides
